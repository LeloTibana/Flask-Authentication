# Flask-Authentication
In this project I tried to implement what I have learnt about Flask Authentication/Security. It is a simple site that asks a user to login or register to gain access to a downloadable PDF file. I created a database that can store user's Names, Emails and Passwords that are Hashed and Salted (multiple times)
